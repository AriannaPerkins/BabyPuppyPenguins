    <h2>Currency Basics</h2>
    <p>The currency of the People's Republic of China is the Renminbi (RMB). The word Renminbi refers to the overall currency, while the Yuan is the denomination of the currency.</p>

    <h2>General Exchange Rate Behavior</h2>
    <p>In the years prior to 2005, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) fixed the RMB/USD exchange rate. The Renminbi was pegged to the US dollar. (The exchange rate was allowed to fluctuate within a very narrow range.)</p>

    <div>

      <p>On July 21, 2005, the People's Bank of China announced that the exchange rate would float based on market supply and demand (thought it would still be a managed exchange rate). This behavior would be based on a basket of currencies. Daily movement of the exchange rate was initially capped at ±0.3%. Through international pressure (and, theoretically, China's realization of the importance of a free-floating exchange rate), this cap expanded to in May 2007 to ±0.5%, again in April 2012 to ±1.0%, and again in March 2014 to ±2.0%.</p>

      <h2>The Currency Basket</h2>
      <p>The Renminbi is currently pegged to a currency basket. The exact contents of this currency basket are unknown. However, according to a statement from the governor of the PBoC in 2005, the primary currencies in the currency basket are the USD, the euro, the Yen, and the Korean won. Each of these currencies is a major currency in Chinese foreign trade settlement. Several other currencies are included in the currency basket, albeit with smaller weights.</p>

      <div>

        <p>Though the major components of the currency basket are known, their weights are not. However, the Yuan did not move much with respect to the US Dollar during the global financial crisis from mid-2008 to mid-2010, suggesting that the Yuan had been pegged to the USD during that period. Research from Cui at Waseda University in Japan attempted to estimate the exact composition of the currency basket. Their work discovered that the USD makes up about 80-83% of the currency basket (though it made up 90% of the currency basket during the global financial crisis). However, it appears that the weight of the USD in the currency basket has decreased recently, signaling that the RMB is now less closely pegged to the dollar. The USD's weight in early 2013's currency basket appears to be as low as 73%. Interestingly enough, the Singapore dollar's weight has grown significantly to 21% in early 2013.</p>

        <div>

          <p>Cui's research suggests that the PBoC has not done a particularly effective job sticking to their currency basket in determining the RMB exchange rate. Nonetheless, the research has confirmed that the RMB has largely transitioned away from a peg on the USD to a currency basket.</p>

          <h2>Predictions for the Future</h2>
          <p>Obviously, we cannot predict the future. However, the recent increases in the daily fluctuation cap indicate that the People's Bank of China has been loosening its grip on the currency. Furthermore, the transition from a USD-pegged currency to one based on a currency basket has moved exchange rates closer to their optimal market-determined values. (In fact, many of the sources we've read seem to suggest that the exchange rates are nearly at their market-determined values.) Our best guess is that this trend will continue and the People's Bank of China will continue to loosen the daily fluctuation cap. Eventually, we expect that the PBoC will allow their currency to float freely. Because the currency is trending towards its actual market value, we would expect that a transition to a free-floating currency would have minimal market impact.</p>
