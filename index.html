    <h2>Currency Basics</h2>
      <p>The currency of the People's Republic of China is the Renminbi (RMB). The word Renminbi refers to the overall currency, while the Yuan is the denomination of the currency.</p>


    <h2>General Exchange Rate Behavior</h2>
      <p>In the years prior to 2005, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) fixed the RMB/USD exchange rate. The Renminbi was pegged to the US dollar and only allowed to fluctuate within a very narrow range of 30 basis points (0.003/$).</p>

      <p>On July 21, 2005, the People's Bank of China announced that the exchange rate would float based on market supply and demand, although it would still be a managed exchange rate. The exchange rate would be managed against a basket of currencies whose composition has never been revealed. Daily movement of the exchange rate was initially capped at ±0.3%. Through international pressure (and, theoretically, China's realization of the importance of a free-floating exchange rate), this cap expanded to in May 2007 to ±0.5%, again in April 2012 to ±1.0%, and again in March 2014 to ±2.0%.</p>


    <h2>The Currency Basket</h2>
      <p>The Renminbi is currently pegged to a currency basket. The exact contents of this currency basket are unknown. However, according to a statement from the governor of the PBoC in 2005, the primary currencies in the currency basket are the USD, the Euro, the Yen, the Korean Won, and the Singaporean Dollar. Each of these currencies is a major currency in Chinese foreign trade settlement. Several other currencies are included in the currency basket, albeit with smaller weights.</p>

      <p>Though the major components of the currency basket are known, their weights have never been released and most likely change over time. When the basket was first created, the dollar was weighted at about 83% of the total. When the global financial crisis of 2008 hit, the weighting of the dollar was increased to over 90% of the basked, which is reflected in the chart below of the daily variance of the yuan against the dollar from 2005 to 2010 (insert chart here).</p>

      <p>Once the worst of the crisis had passed, the PBoC began steadily decreasing the weighting of the dollar and increasing the weights of other currencies, especially the Singaporean Dollar. By early 2013, the USD was down to around 73% of the basket while the Singaporean Dollar had risen to over 20% of the basket, reflecting the growing economic importance of Singapore to East Asia and China. Interestingly, even as the Renminbi has become more variable relative to the dollar it has become much more closely correlated to the currency basket as a whole (Cui 2014).</p>

      <p>Cui's research suggests that the PBoC is very willing to adjust the weightings of their currency basket in order to achieve desired exchange rate behaviors. Even though the PBoC has shown that it will return to a peg against the dollar in times of financial crisis, the general trend has been to move away from the dollar toward a more balanced exchange rate based on market forces and multiple currencies.</p>

    <h2>By-products of a Fixed Exchange Rate</h2>
      <p>- capitol controls (limits on foreign investment in Chinese markets)</p>
      <p>- rapid accumulation of foreign reserves (especially USD in treasuries)</p>
      <p>- build-up of domestic money supply = inflationary pressure</p>

    <h2>Predictions for the Future</h2>
      <p>Obviously, we cannot predict the future. However, the recent increases in the daily fluctuation cap indicate that the People's Bank of China has been loosening its grip on the currency. Furthermore, the transition from a USD-pegged currency to one based on a currency basket has moved exchange rates closer to their optimal market-determined values. (In fact, many of the sources we've read seem to suggest that the exchange rates are nearly at their market-determined values.) Our best guess is that this trend will continue and the People's Bank of China will continue to loosen the daily fluctuation cap. Eventually, we expect that the PBoC will allow their currency to float freely. Because the currency is trending towards its actual market value, we would expect that a transition to a free-floating currency would have minimal market impact.</p>
