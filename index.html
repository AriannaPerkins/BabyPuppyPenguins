    <h2>Currency Basics</h2>
      <p>The currency of the People's Republic of China is the Renminbi (RMB). The word Renminbi refers to the overall currency, while the Yuan is the denomination of the currency.</p>


    <h2>General Exchange Rate Behavior</h2>
      <p>In the years prior to 2005, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) fixed the RMB/USD exchange rate. The Renminbi was pegged to the US dollar and only allowed to fluctuate within a very narrow range of 30 basis points (0.003/$).</p>

      <p>On July 21, 2005, the People's Bank of China announced that the exchange rate would float based on market supply and demand, although it would still be a managed exchange rate. The exchange rate would be managed against a basket of currencies whose composition has never been revealed. Daily movement of the exchange rate was initially capped at ±0.3%. Through international pressure (and, theoretically, China's realization of the importance of a free-floating exchange rate), this cap expanded to in May 2007 to ±0.5%, again in April 2012 to ±1.0%, and again in March 2014 to ±2.0%.</p>


    <h2>The Currency Basket</h2>
      <p>The Renminbi is currently pegged to a currency basket. The exact contents of this currency basket are unknown. However, according to a statement from the governor of the PBoC in 2005, the primary currencies in the currency basket are the USD, the Euro, the Yen, the Korean Won, and the Singaporean Dollar. Each of these currencies is a major currency in Chinese foreign trade settlement. Several other currencies are included in the currency basket, albeit with smaller weights.</p>

      <p>Though the major components of the currency basket are known, their weights have never been released and most likely change over time. When the basket was first created, the dollar was weighted at about 83% of the total. When the global financial crisis of 2008 hit, the weighting of the dollar was increased to over 90% of the basked, which is reflected in the chart below of the daily variance of the yuan against the dollar from 2005 to 2010.</p>

      <div style="text-align:center"><img src="crisis_graph.png" style="width:650px" alt="Graph of Global Financial Crisis" /></div>

      <p>Once the worst of the crisis had passed, the PBoC began steadily decreasing the weighting of the dollar and increasing the weights of other currencies, especially the Singaporean Dollar. By early 2013, the USD was down to around 73% of the basket while the Singaporean Dollar had risen to over 20% of the basket, reflecting the growing economic importance of Singapore to East Asia and China. Interestingly, even as the Renminbi has become more variable relative to the dollar it has become much more closely correlated to the currency basket as a whole (Cui 2014).</p>

      <p>Cui's research suggests that the PBoC is very willing to adjust the weightings of their currency basket in order to achieve desired exchange rate behaviors. Even though the PBoC has shown that it will return to a peg against the dollar in times of financial crisis, the general trend has been to move away from the dollar toward a more balanced exchange rate based on market forces and multiple currencies.</p>

    <h2>By-products of a Fixed Exchange Rate</h2>
      <p>In order to control the exchange rate, China needs control over how many flows into and out of the country. Therefore it has to impose strict regulations and requirements on foreign investments in the country. This prevents many investors who would otherwise invest in China from doing so, potentially slowing economic growth.</p>
      <p>The main method the PBoC has for fixing the exchange rate is providing a supply or demand for USD at the price they want the exchange rate to stay at. Because of the large trade imbalance between China and the US, there is a large inward flow of dollars to Chinese corporations which then want to convert the dollars to yuan. This would drive the value of the yuan up because of strong demand for it, so the central bank has to provide an essentially unlimited supply of yuan for exchange in order to keep the value low. The PBoC is therefore constantly buying dollars and dollar denominated assets (e.g. US Treasuries). Over time China has built up a huge capital reserve of US debt because of this phenomenon.</p>
      <p>Since the PBoC is constantly selling more yuan, the domestic supply of currency grows rapidly. This causes inflationary pressure on the economy, which the government then has to work to limit with more intervention or else risk public unhappiness due to inflation</p>

    <h2>Predictions for the Future</h2>
      <p>Many sources, including the PBoC, believe that the yuan is nearing or in the range of its true market value relative to the dollar. Because this reduces the likelihood of drastic revaluation or devaluation of the yuan, the PBoC is less likely to interfere in the exchange rate market by changing the daily reference value the yuan is allowed to trade against in a way that opposes market trends. It is also likely to continue to widen the daily trading band and loosen its control over the currency. The growing strength of the dollar and slowing of Chinese economic growth mean that the yuan is likely to continue its recent trend of gradual depreciation against the dollar.</p>

      <p>This trend might be broken if the dollar continues to gain strength, causing a flight to quality. This would result in Chinese capital flowing out of the country, reducing liquidity for Chinese markets and rapidly devaluing the yuan. The PBoC wants to avoid both outcomes since they could be damaging to the Chinese economy, which is already slowing its growth rate. In this situation the PBoC would likely take action to prevent further devaluation, possibly including reverting to a peg against the dollar and direct market intervention.</p>
