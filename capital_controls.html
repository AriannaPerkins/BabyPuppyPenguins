    <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Capital controls are measures used or techniques employed by a country’s government or central bank with the goal of restricting inflows or outflows of foreign money. Capital controls can be wide-reaching or specific to a given sector or industry, and they can also target several asset classes or just a few. Examples of capital controls include tariffs, taxes, and regulations. While this definition may seem broad (and, in fact, a staggering number of economic policies can be categorized as capital controls), all of these policy tools and approaches are unified under their intent to restrict the flow of foreign capital into and out of an economy. While capital flow management policies may be referred to as such, they are often euphemistically known as “international policy circles.”</p>

    <h2>Purpose of Controls</h2>
      <p>Capital controls have been the subject of much debate. Some economists believe that controls limit economic progress and efficiency, yet others believe that controls are prudent and add a measure of safety to the economy. However, China’s capital controls have insulated their economy for decades. For example, the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s caused much capital to flow out and many currencies collapsed, yet China was shielded from the brunt of much economic trauma.</p>

    <h2>Relationship Between Capital Controls and Exchange Rate</h2>
      <p>Capital controls allow for China to manage their exchange rate, have discretion over monetary policy, and still control the gradual appreciation of the RMB. This is because capital controls limit the public’s ability to buy and sell foreign exchange and therefore the central bank is able to retain a degree of monetary control. Without these controls, it would be a challenge for China to maintain a fixed exchange rate while keeping this discretion over monetary policy. Additionally, getting rid of capital controls risks financial instability because China’s financial markets are not as deep and liquid as those of other international currencies, and the overall financial system is fragile and inefficient.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, since we predict China will continue to loosen its control on the exchange rate and allow the RMB to float more freely (see the Predictions section of our <a href="exchange_rate.html">Exchange Rate</a> page), this could require a reduciton in capital controls.</p>
