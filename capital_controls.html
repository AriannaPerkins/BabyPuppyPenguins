    <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Capital controls are measures used or techniques employed by a country’s government or central bank with the goal of restricting inflows or outflows of foreign money. Capital controls can be wide-reaching or specific to a given sector or industry, and they can also target several asset classes or just a few. Examples of capital controls include tariffs, taxes, and regulations. While this definition may seem broad (and, in fact, a staggering number of economic policies can be categorized as capital controls), all of these policy tools and approaches are unified under their intent to restrict the flow of foreign capital into and out of an economy. While capital flow management policies may be referred to as such, they are often euphemistically known as “international policy circles.”</p>

    <h2>Purpose of Controls</h2>
      <p>Capital controls have been the subject of much debate. Some economists believe that controls limit economic progress and efficiency, yet others believe that controls are prudent and add a measure of safety to the economy. However, China’s capital controls have insulated their economy for decades. For example, the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s caused much capital to flow out and many currencies collapsed, yet China was shielded from the brunt of much economic trauma.</p>

    <h2>Relationship Between Capital Controls and Exchange Rate</h2>
      <p>Capital controls allow for China to manage their exchange rate, have discretion over monetary policy, and still control the gradual appreciation of the RMB. This is because capital controls limit the public’s ability to buy and sell foreign exchange and therefore the central bank is able to retain a degree of monetary control. Without these controls, it would be a challenge for China to maintain a fixed exchange rate while keeping this discretion over monetary policy. Additionally, getting rid of capital controls risks financial instability because China’s financial markets are not as deep and liquid as those of other international currencies, and the overall financial system is fragile and inefficient.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, since we predict China will continue to loosen its control on the exchange rate and allow the RMB to float more freely (see the Predictions section of our <a href="exchange_rate.html">Exchange Rate</a> page), this could require a reduciton in capital controls.</p>

    <h2>Example Policies in China</h2>
      <p>Most of the largest economies have a liberal policy of capital control, having phased out stricter rules from the past. But most of these same economies have basic stopgap measures in place to prevent against a mass exodus of capital (outflows) during a time of crisis or a massive speculative assault on the currency. Due to its history of extremely tight capital controls and policy of gradual change, China has maintained relatively strict capital controls even as it has grown to be the world’s second largest economy.</p>
      <p>One of the disadvantages of capital controls is that they severely limit capital flow into and out of a country. Often nations want capital flow to be somewhat more liquid in an effort to improve the quality of forex holdings (e.g. more valuable long term treasuries instead of shorter term capital). In an effort to open new market-based avenues for capital inflow and outflow China introduce the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) and Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) programs in 2002 and 2006, respectively. </p>
      <p>QFII was designed to encourage non-speculative (i.e. long term) investment by foreign investment institutions, increasing the quality of China’s forex reserves and preventing capital flight in crises. It allows qualified investors to invest directly in securities listed on China’s stock exchanges, up to approved quotas. Investors must meet certain eligibility requirements and receive approval and obtain quotas from several Chinese regulatory agencies. Limits are placed on how much and how quickly the investor and purchase and sell securities. This is an improvement over the previous inability of foreign investors to directly trade on Chinese exchanges, but in practice there is large variation in how the rules are applied. This makes such trading more difficult and risky than it would otherwise be and discourages participation in the QFII program. The restrictions on investment have been loosened over time, but regulator discretion has also increased which combine to increase the possible profit from investment in China but also the risk.</p>
      <p>The QDII program was designed to allow private investors to spend China’s excess foreign capital reserves in offshore markets, bringing back more valuable securities. QDII was implemented similarly to QFII and faces many similar issues. Domestic (Chinese) investment institutions must meet certain eligibility requirements and are limited in the amount and type of assets they can purchase. The QDII program was implemented in an even more piecemeal way than QFII. Because China has an excess of capital reserves, the QDII program expanded much more rapidly than QFII. It reached numbers of qualified institutions and investment quotas in a few months that QFII took years to achieve.</p>
      <p>The QFII and QDII programs were early steps in transitioning to an open market system, allowing direct investment by foreign private institutions in domestic markets and domestic institutions in foreign markets for the first time. As China continues to open its markets, concern has shifted from institutional investments to inexperienced domestic individuals who make risky investments in foreign markets.</p>

    <h2>Current Trends</h2>
      <p>There are many ways to measure the quantity and quality of capital controls, each of which provides slightly different information about the controls. Chen and Qiang (2015) created an index system using de jure and hybrid measures of capital controls. The results of applying this analysis from 1999 to 2012 are shown in the figure below, normalized to 1999 levels of control.</p>

      <div style="text-align:center"><img src="chen_qiang_index.png" style="width:650px" alt="Graph of Indices of Chinese Capital Controls" /></div>

      <p>Capital controls on both current account (red) and capital account (blue) both show a trend of gradual decline corresponding with China’s relaxation of exchange rate controls. Several significant events, including China joining the World Trade Organization and the 2008 financial crisis, are marked on the plot. Interestingly, China’s capital controls increased during the crisis just like its exchange rate became more closely tied to the dollar. Clearly China feared the impact the crisis might have on its currency and economy, and was not afraid to take direct action to prevent harm. This suggests that any future reforms might be reversed by another global financial crisis.</p>
      <p>Another commonly used measure of capital controls is the covered interest rate differential. This is a price measure of capital controls with an equilibrium value (i.e. no controls) of zero. In countries with capital controls, the return on assets can vary from assets with similar risk categories in countries without such controls. The figure below, excerpted from Cheung and Herrala 2013, shows the covered interest rate differential (black) and another measure (grey) for China and the US.</p>

      <div style="text-align:center"><img src="covered_interest_rate_differential.png" style="width:650px" alt="Graph of Covered Interest Rate Differential Between the US and China" /></div>

      <p>The differential does not trend to zero, which suggests that capital controls are still present and strong in China. Note how the differential spikes in 2008 during the financial crisis, corroborating the increase in controls noted by Chen and Chiang’s index.</p>
      <p>Together, these measures indicate that China maintains strong capital controls, impacting the financial markets and exchange rate. They also suggest that China is slowly reducing the amount of control it exerts over capital movement alongside its relaxation of exchange rate control. This trend is likely to continue as long as the correlated trend in the exchange rate does.</p>
